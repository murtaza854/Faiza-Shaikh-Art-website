      content="Faiza Shaikh was introduced to art from a very early age. Faiza's obsession with art continued at Fielden Park Art School in Manchester and after that, South Trafford College for textile designing, and finally at St. Martins college in London. With this knowledge of technique and History of Art, Faiza decided to make her own mark in the art world.

      She decided to paint Philosophy, Politics, and Poetry on canvas. Her signature work is recognised by the use of gold and silver leaf scripted with the philosophical message. Her work is rooted in the contemporary world. She chooses not to present the way we are in a manner that questions this or states what we see around us everyday. She is not unconcerned with issues of urban existence, or racial discrimination, of the disparities between the rich and poor. She is a part of this world, she lives and breathes its air as we do, and is as affected by its pollutants, but her paintings present a quest for perfection, which takes impetus from this world without depicting its context.
      
      Faiza has developed a special technique by which the canvas is converted into a luscious, rich silk and velvet texture.
      
      Strong bold colours, sharp contrasts and a sense of power and modernity strikes you very strongly when you see Faiza's works. Based in Dubai, Faiza has been painting for a while and her work is extremely unusual and eye catching.
      
      Adding further dimension to her work and progressing from her signature work the new series includes pop art - fusion of West and East, comic characters entangled into truck art, reflections- paradigm soul searching in the quest to unlock the mysteries of life. Icons- contemporary icons with their claim to fame. Great city series- collage of all the things we love about the great cities.
